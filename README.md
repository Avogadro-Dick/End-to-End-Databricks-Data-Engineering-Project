#End-to-End Databricks Data Engineering Project
##Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics on Databricks

Welcome to the End-to-End Databricks Data Engineering Project repository! 

This project showcases a modern, cloud-native data warehouse and analytics solution built on Databricks using PySpark and Delta Lake, following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

Designed as a portfolio-grade, enterprise-style data engineering project, it demonstrates the full lifecycle of data engineering - from raw data ingestion and deep ETL processing to dimensional modeling and analytics-ready data.

 Project Overview

This project implements a Lakehouse-based Data Warehouse that:

Ingests raw CSV data from external sources (GitHub) into Databricks

Applies data cleaning, standardization, and transformation using PySpark

Implements Medallion Architecture for scalable and maintainable pipelines

Builds star-schema dimensional models (fact and dimension tables)

Produces analytics-ready Gold tables for BI and reporting use cases

The solution reflects real-world enterprise data engineering practices, replacing traditional SQL Server–based warehouses with a modern Databricks Lakehouse architecture.
